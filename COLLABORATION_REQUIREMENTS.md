# Collaborative Task and Group Management Requirements

## Task Types
- **Personal Task**: A task created and managed by a single user (no collaboration).
- **Collaborative Task**: A task assigned within a group, where multiple users can participate.

## Group Management
- Users can create a group.
- The user who creates the group is automatically assigned as the group admin.
- The group admin can add or remove members from the group.
- The group admin can assign the admin role to another member (admin rights can be transferred).

## Task Assignment in Groups
- Tasks can be created within a group context.
- The group admin can assign tasks to any group member.
- Each group member can view tasks assigned to them within the group.
- Group tasks are visible to all group members, but only the assigned member (or admin) can update the task status.

## Admin Privileges
- The group admin can:
  - Add/remove members
  - Assign/reassign tasks
  - Transfer admin rights
  - Delete the group

## Member Privileges
- Group members can:
  - View all group tasks
  - Update the status of tasks assigned to them
  - Leave the group

## Summary of Steps
1. User creates a group (becomes admin).
2. Admin adds members to the group.
3. Admin creates tasks and assigns them to members.
4. Members see and update their assigned tasks.
5. Admin can transfer admin rights or remove members.
6. Group and tasks can be managed collaboratively.
